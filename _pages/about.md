Hi, I'm Usama!

PasteBlog is something I started when I first began my training in Machine Learning at Illinois State University. I am very ambitious and explorative within the grand field of Computer Science: I enjoy programming, game development, web design, and, of course, machine learning! There is no 'one thing' I do as I have an ever-expanding range of interests and goals. I hope you enjoy the blogs, and please don't hesitate to reach out to me for any suggestions!
